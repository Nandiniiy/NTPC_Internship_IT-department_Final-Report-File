The report attached  contains all the information about the one month internship that I did at NTPC (Auriaya branch) in the IT department.
The primary objectives were to gain practical IT experience, understand the workings of an IT department, 
and contribute to meaningful projects.
My personal goals included improving technical skills, learning industry best practices, and developing a professional network.
During the course of this internship, I had a brief understanding of the computer systems and information technology systems.
Our mentor directed us very efficiently and so we were able to work with out full potentials and gain insights from the all the projects that underwent.
